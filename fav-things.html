<h2>Playing guitar</h2>
<p>I love playing Guitar. I have been playing since I was 7 years old, now I'm 15. My first guitar is an acoutic guitar, and around 5 or 6 years ago I got a Fender Squire Bullet Stratocaster, electric guitar. It is a beginner guitar, but I don't treat it like one. Even though its a beginner guitar, it'll still a great guitar, and is my only electric guitar at the moment. </p>
