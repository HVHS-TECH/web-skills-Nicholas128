<h2>Playing guitar</h2>
<p>I love playing Guitar. I have been playing since I was 7 years old, now I'm 15. My first guitar is an acoutic guitar, and around 5 or 6 years ago I got a Fender Squire Bullet Stratocaster, electric guitar. It is a beginner guitar, but I don't treat it like one. Even though its a beginner guitar, it'll still a great guitar, and is my only electric guitar at the moment. </p>

<h2>recording/mixing music</h2>  
<p>My intrest of mixing music started at the bassist's house. The band started to do some recording with his gear. And at that time, I learned how to pan audio in the headphones. I found it a fun experence, becuase I was spinning around the audio in the headphones. I thaught it was the coolest thing ever, but it gave the bassist a headache.  </p>
